0. Recurrence relation => Recursive function 
    as we are trying to solve the bigger problem by solving a number of smaller problems.
1. Do not confuse between the recursive call and the return statement. They both are very different concepts.
2. Tracing Tree:
    (a) The commands to be run after the recursive call.
    (b) Print outputs side by side.
3. Time Complexity and Space Complexity Analysis
    1. Time Complexity:
        a. The total number of recursive function calls.
        b. Determine the BigO complexity using the recurrence function call.
            - f(n) represented in terms of the f(n-1), ... so on, .. f(n-k), then in terms of the base case k=n, f(n) = __ f(0)
    2. Space Complexity:
        a. The depth of recursion or the height of the recursion tree.
    [Tips]:
        a. If each recursive call makes 2 recursive calls further then the time complexity is O(2^n).
        b. Have to find the upper limit, so you can assume the number of calls to be more than the actual if required, 
            like in fibonacci series recursive function.
        c. Number of calls for f(0), f(1), f(2), .... and then try to estimate the relation between them.
        d. Count at each level, number of levels then the total number.


4. Tower of Hanoi recursive solution 
        [S] [I] [D]
    1. Recurrence relation => Recursive function
    2. The base case [Easy] 
        There are two base cases:
            (a) Moving a single plate from one tower to another --> case if(n==1)
            (b) Moving a set of two plates from one tower to another --> case if(n==2)
    3. Recurrence relation [Difficult]
        Moving 'n' number of plates from A to C via B can be considered as equivalent to moving two plates.
        A set of 3 steps as if we were moving only 2 plates:
            (a) Consider the top (n-1) plates in the [S] as a single plate, and move it from [S] to [I]. [Recursive call]
            (b) Move the last plate (nth plate) from the [S] to [D].
            (c) Move the n-1 plates from [I] to [D]. [Recursive call]
